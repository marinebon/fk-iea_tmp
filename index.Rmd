## (Temporary) Technical Development Notes

This site is a temporary demonstration of publishing as an [Rmarkdown website](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/rmarkdown-site.html#publishing-websites).

The menu is very easy to update in the [_site.yml]( https://github.com/marinebon/fk-iea_tmp/blob/master/_site.yml).

For example:

- [Climate](./climate.html): see infographic modal popup by clicking on temperature

- Nature > [Protected Areas](n_mpa.html): note use of tabsets and floating toc
