  Welcome to the Florida Keys Integrated Ecosystem Assessment (IEA)
site: distill::distill_website
---

This site is a temporary demonstration of using [Distill for R Markdown](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) to generate the website and embed figures, infographics, etc.

The menu is very easy to update in the [_site.yml]( https://github.com/marinebon/fk-iea_tmp/blob/master/_site.yml).

For example:

- [Externalities](./externalities.html): see infographic modal popup by clicking on temperature

- Nature > [Protected Areas](na_mpa.html): note use of [full screen layout](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/figures.html#full-screen-layout) for grouper density inside vs outside MPAs

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
